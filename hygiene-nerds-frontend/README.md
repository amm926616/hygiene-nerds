Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a **Spring Boot** backend, it combines modern frontend design with a solid and scalable backend architecture.

This project also serves as my personal portfolio website, showcasing my ability to build full-stack applications from scratch.

## 🚧 Current Status

- 🛡️ Spring Security setup needs refinement. I'm currently learning and patching holes in authentication and authorization.
- 🔁 Code optimization is ongoing – especially removing redundancy and improving structure in the React frontend.
- 🐞 Some bugs and edge cases still exist and are being resolved gradually.
